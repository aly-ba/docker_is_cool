CMD: `build`

FLAGS: `-t`

- So it seems very weird to have to continue learning all of these Docker
  CLI commands. Is there a way that we can 'save' the state of setup?
  - We can write a Dockerfile that can become a recipe for our own custom
    Docker image.
- So how can I get started with this Dockerfile business?
- That is great, but there is no way to keep track of the built image or do
  I have to memorize that that weird hash value?
- Are there any considerations that I should be aware of when writing a Dockerfile and using that to build a docker image?
