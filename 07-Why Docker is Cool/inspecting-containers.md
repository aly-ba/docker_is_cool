CMD: `image`, `attach`, `exec`, `search`

FLAGS: `-i`, `-t`

- What is a Docker image?
- How can I know what images I have available to me? Locally? On the interwebs?
- How can I tell what containers I have available to me locally?
- If I started a container, can I ssh into a container like I can with a virtual
  machine to interact with the operating system?
- That is a little bit of work to interact with a running container, are there
  ways to just run a quick command?
