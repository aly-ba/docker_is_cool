- So now that we have see docker-compose as a tool. How can we make a
  multi-container application?
- So can you remind us what the services represent?
- So what should we have in our services?
- So I know that we wanted to have persistent data using those volumes, is there
  a way to get those available to us in a compose project?
- So now that we have volumes, do we always reference them by name in the services?
- Are there any other issues that we should be aware of?
