- How do I use Docker?
- How do I start containers?
- How do I stop containers?
- So what is the relationship between images and containers?
- Where can I find new images?
- I noticed that some containers hijack the stdout,
    is there anyway that I can overcome that?
- Well, that is great that I can get a container to run in the background,
    but it seems like we have a new problem. How do I know what containers
    are running?
