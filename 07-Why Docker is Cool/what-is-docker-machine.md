CMDs:

  + `docker-machine ls`
  + `docker-machine create -d virtualbox {name}`
  + `docker-machine kill`
  + `docker-machine ip`
  + `docker-machine rm`
  + `docker-machine ssh {machine}`
  + `docker-machine scp {file} {machine:/path/to/folder}`

- So what is Docker Machine?
- So what would be a good use of the Docker Machine tool?
- Now that we have all of those machines setup, how should I interact with those
  machines?
- Ah! So we have ssh, does that mean that I have scp (secure copy)?
  - Yep
- Can we inspect or find information about the machines?
- What if we want clean up?
- So if we are using containers, what is the purpose of the docker-machine tool?
