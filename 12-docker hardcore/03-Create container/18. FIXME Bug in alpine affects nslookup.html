<p>In the next assignment, you'll be using the tool <code>nslookup</code> inside the <code>alpine:latest</code> image, but in early 2020 there was a bug introduced to the latest Alpine image 3.11.3 that affects how <code>nslookup</code> works on hostnames, so for the next Assignment on DNS&nbsp;Round Robin, either change your command to work around it with <code>nslookup search.</code> (with a dot added) or use an older Alpine image like <code>alpine:3.10</code>.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Hopefully, they'll fix it soon. I'm tracking this bug:&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/gliderlabs/docker-alpine/issues/539" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://github.com/gliderlabs/docker-alpine/issues/539</a></p>
